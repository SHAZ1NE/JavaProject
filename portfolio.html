      <h3>Shameer Syed Alam</h3>
      <p>I began coding in Year 7 where I taught myself Python. I went on to improve my skills throughout the years,
         I also learnt a small amount of C# as I used Unity at A-Level for my NEA project.

      <h3>Java Spring Term Project : (NOT) Hollow Knight</h3>
      <p>Using Java I created a platformer based off of the indie game Hollow Knight. The player plays
      as a character that has a projectile attack and has to collect a currency called "soul pearls" once
      the required amount is collected then the player goes to an npc and can progress to the next level. The
      first 3 levels follow this format but the fourth is a boss level where the player must defeat a large boss
      to which they then complete the game after that. 

      Developing the game was quite challenging and I learnt alot about java as a programming language. This was my 
      first time using an OOP to this extent. The hardest part of the project, in my opinion, was the saving and loading
      function as figuring out how to load the bodies again proved very tricky. Furthermore allowing different classes to 
      have access to private fields was also quite awkward sometimes. Finally making enemies patrol an area also took quite 
      some effort.
